# US Cardiovascular Data Analysis [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) <img alt="Pandas" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white" /> <img alt="NumPy" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white" />  <img alt="Jupyter" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-%23F37626.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Jupyter&logoColor=white" />

**This project analyses the dataset from different angles and draws out the conclusion as what factors could cause Cardiovascular disease. Various concepts of Data Analysis were used such as Feature Engineering, Spliting, Slicing, Filtering and Correlating.**


**The Dataset was downloaded from [kaggle dataset](kaggle.com).**
